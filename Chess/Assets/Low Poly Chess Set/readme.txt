THANK YOU FOR PURCHASING!

HOW TO USE IT
**************************

All models were made in real world scale (centimeters) so you can use them as part of game scenarios. 

All prefabs are in 10x scale for easy visualization. For real world dimensions set scale to 1.
You can also use them to make a chess game, in that case, I highly recomend using the default x10 scale or adjusting the scale to fit your needs.

Includes 4 different textures, but you can apply your own textures as well

Enjoy your new models!
