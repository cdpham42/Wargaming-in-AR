# Wargaming-in-AR

This project was to create an Augmented Reality Wargaming Platform intended for the United States Navy as a strategic planning tool, developed for the Microsoft Hololens using Unity3D. The project was undertaken as part of the Booz Allen Hamilton Summer Games Intern program, a 10-week intern program to develop real-world products. At the end of the 10 weeks all interns presented their projects at the Summer Games Challenge Cup for judges selected from Booz Allen Hamilton's executives.

Chess was created as a stepping stone for the final product. It was realized that during development we had everything necessary to implement chess in augmented reality with the Microsoft Hololens. Setup requires players to place their pieces on the chessboard. Players are unable to move their opponent's pieces, so taking an opponent's piece requires the opponent to remove their piece from play.

SharedSpaceProject2 contains the final version of the Wargame at the end of the 10 weeks. The game overlays a map on the real world and allows the user to place and move units at will. Limited player and unit visibility is implemented, where a player cannot see the opponent's units until the player's own units are within a set distance of their opponent's units. The scenario used for the wargame is the South China Sea, an area of geopolitical tension and sea-based operations.

The Pitch with Videos powerpoint is the final presentation used for the challenge cup.
